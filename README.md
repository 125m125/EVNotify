### The idea behind EVNotify
Originally this application was developed to have a possibility to remotly see the charging state for the Hyundai IONIQ, which isn't possible in Europe due to missing BlueLink connection.
Then I decided to enhance it so you'll get notified when the desired state of charge has been achieved. Also I want to support more cars in the future.

Image the following situation:
You are charging your electric vehicle on a fast charger. To proceed with your roadtrip, you need to charge until 80%. You are drinking a coffee in the meantime. But you want to drive away as fast as possible because every minute that passes costs time and money. Normally you have to check for the charging state every few minutes, leave everything, physically needs to go to the car, which is annoying.
With EVNotify you can just check the state of charge remotly - or simply gets notified when the desired state of charge is set so you can go. Without having to worry every about your state of charge every few minutes. Simply enjoy!
